# Microphone-preamplifier
 Preamplifier for an electret microphone capsule.

# Description
 The circuit consists of two OpAmp-stages which together have around 24dB gain. The OpAmps chosen for this project are OP27-OpAmps for their DIP8-package and relatively high gain-bandwidth-product. The Coupling-capacitors are foil-capacitors, to minimizie their impact on the sonic performance. The Amplifier is designed to work off of a 12V power-supply, which is regulated down to 8V with an internal linear regulator. An optional gain-adjustment can be fitted to the second gain stage.

 # Specs
  The simulated Bode-plot of the amplifier shows a flat gain-curve (-1dB relative to 1kHz) from <10Hz to >200kHz.
